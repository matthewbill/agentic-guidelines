# Filters Guidelines

section header - filters just for that sections

page header - filters for all things on the page (so in the above case if there were filters at the top it would filter the kpis as well)

app level (dont have this yet - but we will do when we have an org or team switcher) - filters across all pages and is sticky/rememebrs what you select
