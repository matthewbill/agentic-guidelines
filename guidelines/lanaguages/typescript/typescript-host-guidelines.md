# TypeScript Host Guidelines

Hosts can be APIs, server actions, or any other entry point into the application. The host layer is responsible for handling incoming requests, invoking the appropriate services, and returning responses.

- Should use the web-service-pipeline.ts for consistent request handling.
- Should get the user details.
